# Julia Modina: Digital Design
Portfolio (2021-present)

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Julia, and I am high school student interested in graphic design & digital media. Although I am new to the digital design world, I enjoy creating digital art for numerous clubs and groups based at my school, which you will see many examples of in this website. Most of my designs are made in ProCreate!
